## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Our team will use the pandas library to clean and transform our data and export that data into csv files. We will make sure all of the data types are accurate, drop null values, etc. Then we will create a schema/flow chart with the appropriate primary and secondary keys as well as their respective data types, which should highlight any connections that can be made between csv files.

## Database Construction
We will import the clean csv files into SQL for easy querries and analysis. Aditional tables may be created with the SQL querry tool depending on what needs to be analyzed.

## Machine Learning
We'll be using SK Learn for our Machine Learning Library, as well as Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. We'll begin with a supervised machine model because the data is already labeled. This model will classify the results into two groups: Death & Comorbidities.

## Dashboard
Tableau will be the primary technology used to create an interactive, visually appealing dashboard. The two main reasons Tabluea will be our primary Dashboard technology are Tableau has no row limit & Tableau allows us to avoid static dashboards. No row limit allows us to upload and analyze the millions of rows of data we've gathered, without overly-long processing times. Typically, dashboards are shared through PDF's, making them static from the moment they're sent; however, Tableau allows us to share our dashboards and will automatically update them with any changes.
