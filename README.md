# Covid_Comorbidities
Pulling from multiple sources of data, this project aims to answer the question of: Do individuals with comorbidities die more from covid than those with no known health issues?

## Hypothesis
Main Hypothesis: Individuals with comorbidities die more from covid than those with no known health issues.

## Technologies
A brief description of the technologies we're using:

* SK Learn (Machine Learning Library)
* Pandas & J'upyter Notebook' - (Machine Learning/Database)
* SQL (Database)
* Postgres (Database)
* Tableau (Visualization)

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SKLearn, Pandas & J'upyter Notebook are the ML technologies we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___.

## Dashboard
Tableau will be the primary technology used to create an interactive, visually appealing dashboard. The two main reasons Tableau will be our primary Dashboard technology are Tableau has no row limit & Tableau allows us to avoid static dashboards. No row limit allows us to upload and analyze the millions of rows of data we've gathered, without overly-long processing times. Typically, dashboards are shared through PDF's, making them static from the moment they're sent; however, Tableau allows us to share our dashboards and will automatically update them with any changes.
